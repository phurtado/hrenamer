# hrenamer

File renamer written in Haskell. 
Copies the files in a folder so that their names become the name of the folder plus a sequence number.

## Remarks

I wasn't impressed by Haskell's "scripting" capabilities. The code, while terse, seems hard to maintain. Type conversions must be done all the time (although this was even worse in Rust, surprisingly). And making a simple loop with a counter that doesn't always get increased is a mess compared to any imperative language. It's probably not great code anyway, but I'm not experienced at all in Haskell.
